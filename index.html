                <strong>Mø-Duel</strong>, the new CRC robotics game that challenges teams to design and create robots that can work together to score as many points as possible during five-minute matches also known as heats.
                Each heat is played on an 8-by-5 tile field with bumps and uneven surfaces, making this years driving much harder than past years.
                Four robots compete at once (<strong>two blue and two yellow</strong>) forming temporary alliances. Every robot begins on its team's colored tile and is only considered active when it leaves it's starting zone.

            <section>
                <h3>Game Pieces</h3>
                There are three types of pieces on the field:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fan</li>
                    <li>Core</li>
                    <li>Turbine</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                Each piece comes in <strong>blue, yellow, or red</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blue/Yellow pieces</strong> → working parts</li>
                    <li><strong>Red pieces</strong> → broken parts (usable only in repair stations)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h4>IMPORTANT!</h4>
                Robots are only able to carry <strong>one piece at a time</strong>, either in their team's color or red. Any piece that rolls off the field is <strong>out of play for the rest of the heat</strong>.
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>How to Score</h3>
                <h4>Engine Scoring</h4>
                Place your team's color piece into an engine:
                <ul>
                    <li>1 piece →<strong> 50 points</strong></li>
                    <li>2 pieces →<strong> 100 points</strong></li>
                    <li>3 pieces → <strong> 250 points</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Repair Station</h4>
                Place a <strong>red piece</strong> into a repair station:
                <ul><li>Red piece →<strong> 30 points</strong></li></ul>
                <h4>Spare Parts Zone</h4>
                Stack your team's colored pieces in the spare parts zone:
                <ul><li>Each piece →<strong> 40 points</strong></li></ul>
                <h4>End-Game Bonuses</h4>
                At the end of each heat, two bonuses are applied:
                <span class="bullet-points">Team with the tallest stack →<strong> +60%</strong></span>
