            <h2>About Clue</h2>
            <section class="inner-section">
                <p>Clue is a famous murder mystery board game. Originally named <i>Murder!</i>, the goal of the game is to find out who murdered Mr. Boddy. As the game goes on, the players may ask each other questions and use their critical thinking skills to deduce three things: the murderer, the murder weapon and the scene of the crime. Once players believe they have figured out all three unknowns they must move to the center  of the board and submit their guess. The first player to find these three things correctly wins.

                    <section>
                        <strong>Mø-Duel</strong>, the new CRC robotics game that challenges teams to design and create robots that can work together to score as many points as possible during five-minute matches also known as heats.
                        Each heat is played on an 8-by-5 tile field with bumps and uneven surfaces, making this years driving much harder than past years.
                        Four robots compete at once (<strong>two blue and two yellow</strong>) forming temporary alliances. Every robot begins on its team's colored tile and is only considered active when it leaves it's starting zone.

                        <h3>Game Pieces</h3>
                        There are three types of pieces on the field:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fan</li>
                            <li>Core</li>
                            <li>Turbine</li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src="images/turbine.jpeg" alt="Picture of turbine">
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        Each piece comes in <strong>blue, yellow, or red</strong>:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Blue/Yellow pieces</strong> → working parts</li>
                            <li><strong>Red pieces</strong> → broken parts (usable only in repair stations)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    
                    <section>
                    <h4>IMPORTANT!</h4>
                    Robots are only able to carry <strong>one piece at a time</strong>, either in their team's color or red. Any piece that rolls off the field is <strong>out of play for the rest of the heat</strong>.
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>How to Score</h3>
                    <h4>Engine Scoring</h4>
                    Place your team's color piece into an engine:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 piece →<strong> 50 points</strong></li>
                        <li>2 pieces →<strong> 100 points</strong></li>
                        <li>3 pieces → <strong> 250 points</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Repair Station</h4>
                    Place a <strong>red piece</strong> into a repair station:
                    <ul><li>Red piece →<strong> 30 points</strong></li></ul>
                    <h4>Spare Parts Zone</h4>
                    Stack your team's game pieces in the spare parts zone:
                    <ul><li>Each piece →<strong> 40 points</strong></li></ul>
                    <h4>End-Game Bonuses</h4>
                    At the end of each heat, two bonuses are applied:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tallest Stack Bonus</strong>
                            <span class="bullet-points">&cir; Team with the tallest stack →<strong> +60%</strong></span>
                            <span class="bullet-points">&cir; If tied → <strong>+30% each</strong>
                        </li>       
                        <li><strong>Zone Control Bonus</strong>
                            <span class="bullet-points">&cir; Team with the most pieces in their zone → <strong>+40%</strong></span>
                            <span class="bullet-points">&cir; If tied → <strong>+20% each</strong></span>
                        </li> 
                    </ul> 
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Fair Play & Penalties</h3>
                    To keep heats fair and safe, the following rules apply:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You may <strong>not block more than one engine or repair station</strong> at a time.</li>
                        <li>You may <strong>not trap, hit or smash</strong> other robots.</li>
                        <li>When time runs out, the game ends and points are calculated.</li>
                        <li>If your robot becomes non-functional, your team loses <strong>10% of its total score for every 30 seconds</strong> the robot remains inactive.</li>
                        <li>Asking for an officials help will result in a <strong>penalty of 20% of its total score for the heat</strong></li>
                        <li>Carrying more than a single game piece at a time will result in a<strong>20% heat penaltyt</strong></li>  
                        <li>Intentionally throwing game pieces off field will result in a <strong>40% heat penalty</strong></li>                 
                     </ul>

                <p>It's the moment we've all been waiting for. Who killed Mr. Nemeth? You've found the murderer, you have the weapon, hold on… what room did he get murdered in? If you go back to each section of the website (about us, roster, journal, etc.), you will notice each one has a theme surrounding a room, but one room is missing. The missing room will give you the missing piece of the puzzle.</p>
